# Logistic-regression
Multiclass Classification for Cirrhosis Prediction
This project involves building a Logistic Regression model to predict different stages of cirrhosis in patients based on clinical data. The model handles a multiclass classification problem, providing predictions for various stages of liver disease.
Key features include:
Data preprocessing and feature engineering
Model training and evaluation
Performance metrics for multiclass classification
